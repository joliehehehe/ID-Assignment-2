# ID Assignment 2 - BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! Fan Wiki Website
In this project, I will be creating a [Fan Wiki website](https://joliehehehe.github.io/ID-Assignment-2/) for the in-game cards from the Japanese/English rhythm game BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! This project aims to be able to list down cards from the game, as well as details such as name and statistics.

## Design Process
This is my [initial wireframe](https://xd.adobe.com/view/d8b30417-4128-4c38-9eee-e847f0a020a9-8de0/) for my website. I chose to design the wireframe like this because I felt that users will enjoy a simpler layout. The layout of the cards is quite simple and texts are not too messy.

This website is for fans who play BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! who would like to look at sorted information of different cards.

- As an avid player of the game, I want to be able to view different cards so that I can compare and choose which cards I should use in the game for maximum effeciency.
- As an avid player of the game, I want to sort the list of cards to display only certain types of attributes and rarity so that I can look at cards of certain types.

## Features
### Existing Features
- Navigation bar 
    - Allows users to navigate to different sections of the website easily.
- 'Home' Page

- 'Cards' Page
    - Allows users to see the cards from the games as well as the card's description such as name, rarity, attribute, skill and power statistics.
- 'Sort by Attribute' button
    - Allows users to see certain types of attribute cards (Cool, Power, Happy, Pure) only so that it is less crowded and messy.
- 'Sort by Rarity' button
    - Allows users to see certain types of rarity cards (1★, 2★, 3★, 4★) only so that it is easy to find that type amoung the other cards.

### Features Left to Implement

- 'My Cards' Page - Allow users view their selected seperately instead of scrolling through the page multiple times.
